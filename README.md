# PolyPractice
Practice with polymorphism and inheritance

This file is just a practice. It uses a heirarchy to define both two and three dimensional shapes.
In the main method all there is an array that declares all the shapes polymorphically.
The program reads the array and displays the shapes information.
If the shape is two dimensional it displays the area of the shape,
if the shape is three dimensional it displays both the volume and the area of the shape.
